# Turtle Race

A fun Python project using the `turtle` graphics library to simulate a race between turtles. This project is designed for beginners to learn about Python programming, graphics, and basic game logic.

## Features
- Multiple turtles racing across the screen
- Randomized movement for each turtle
- Simple, interactive graphics
- Easy to customize and extend

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uzmanjawaid/turtle_race.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd turtle_race
   ```
3. **Run the main script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `turtle` (standard library, no installation needed)

## How It Works
The program creates several turtles, each with a unique color. They race from left to right, moving forward by a random amount each turn. The first turtle to reach the finish line wins!

## Customization
- Change the number of turtles
- Modify turtle colors
- Adjust race length or speed
